## Typography in Modern HTML Emails

This is the initial setup to showcase Typogaphy in HTML email. The code here gets modified on each step, based on what is being tested.

The layout HTML should be familiar from Lesson 03. It contains the most common typography elements. Headings, paragraphs and basic formattings. Also the basic CSS formating of these elements is added to the HEAD style. Most styles come from the default stylesheet of the email clients.

Some elements disappear on a lot of clients. Big differences are in visual appearence between mobile and desktop clients. Links are unformatted.
