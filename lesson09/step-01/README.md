## Typography in Modern HTML Emails

In the previous step we "forgot" to add basic formatting for some heading elements (h4, h5, h6), list elements, like UL and OL, and for `link`s. Necessary styling was added inside `head` as embedded styles.

New element with classname "sectionHeading" was added to showcase a different approach for inner headings. Also basic CSS was added to `head` element.
