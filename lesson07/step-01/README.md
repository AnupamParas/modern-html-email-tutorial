## Bulletproof buttons in Modern HTML Emails

In this lesson we are testing first having a look at the Litmus recommended bulletproof email buttons:
- VML-based button,
- Padding-based button,
- Border-based button,
- Padding + Border-based button.

We are adding `style="font-size:16px;font-family:sans-serif;color:#ffffff;text-decoration:none;"` and
also setting `line-height` property to `30px` or `54px`, to have a standardised way on how the buttons look.
