## Content images in Modern HTML Emails

The two sample images in the project setup got a "600px" width dimension - one as an HTML attribute and one as an inline CSS style property - which resolved oversized image display for:

Desktop:
- Apple Mail 9, 10
- Outlook 2000, 2002, 2003, 2011, 2016
- Thunderbird

and Outlook 2007, 2010, 2013, 2013 120 DPI, Lotus Notes 8 and Windows 10 Mail, when applied as an attribue.

All clients, but Android 4.4 looked nice.

Web clients:
- Yahoo! Mail
- Web.de
- Outlook clients
- Office 365
- Mail.ru

All clients, but Terra Mail looked nice.
