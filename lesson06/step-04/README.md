## Content images in Modern HTML Emails

Building on the experiences of the previous steps, we apply pixel width in the HTML "width" attribute, and a "max-width" property in the CSS "style" attribute. We also add a "display:block" to the "style" attribute on the image tag, to prevent the cell taking up extra space below the image.


Error only occurs for Office 365 Firefox and Chrome.
